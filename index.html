            <pre class="par">
The gold-source engine is a physics engine developed by <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/" target="_blank">Valve software</a> back in 1998
It was the primary focus for valves Breakthrough title Half-Life, and was even used by Gearbox Software when developing <i>James Bond 007: Nightfire</i>.
It is based from ID software's Quake engine but with enough modifications to make it unique and revolutionary for its time.

While Its sequal (Half-Life 2) Might have blown this games engine out of the water its still important to remember what came before.
